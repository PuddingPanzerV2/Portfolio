        Here 2 friends and I hiked up to the Muttseh√ºtte in Switzerland. It was
        the first time I had brought my Black Magic Pocket Cinema camera to a
        hike. As we started the hike too late, we had to hurry more than I
        liked. I couldn't take much time to film things because of that. Hiking
        down, I slipped a little bit, almost faceplanted a rock and distributed
        my camera gear in the beautiful meadow because I had to start running
        while still filming things to catch the last cable car down to the
        valley. We also had to completely run through a 2 km long tunnel at the
        end of the hike and it felt like a scene in a movie because I said to my
        friends that I couldn't catch up anymore as I had so much camera gear
        with me and was much less in shape than my friends. But they sacrificed
        themselves to carry some of my stuff while running as I was about to
        die. 10/10 Experience.

        I've made this video to show people Alicante and the vicinity through my
        eyes and mood. I really love this part of Spain as I partially grew up
        with it. My grandparents lived in Muchamiel (Mutxamel) and we went there
        every summer for some weeks. I just loved every minute I spent there and
        am really thankful that I could experience all that. So, I was really
        happy that I finally could capture some of its beauty with a somewhat
        decent camera (BMPCC6K). I already took my past cameras to Spain every
        time we went. But never uploaded most of it because I wasn't fully happy
        or it was just experimental stuff. The quality was also not great with
        my old cameras. I began filming with a GoPro Hero 4 with no screen at
        all. Then I bought a Canon EOS 70D, which is more of a camera for
        photography than videography. Later I sold this camera to buy a 7D,
        which was again more a camera for photography than videography. The
        BMPCC6K isn't the best too because of missing autofocus support etc. But
        it's finally a camera meant for videography, and I am damn happy with
        it, even when it's hard sometimes with the manual focus and the
        additional battery I have to carry.

        it happened almost every time this year, it started to rain as I started
        to film and I was struggling to record things while keeping my gear dry.
        But I made the best of the footage I got, and one scene was even recorded
        by Louis Grob with his mobile phone because it was just a clean line, and
        sadly, I wasn't recording at the time. But I had to include it even if the
        quality wasn't that good. Anyways, big thanks to these guys for bringing
        me with them for such things.

        This is one of my more experimental videos where I just try out things,
        wondering how they will look when I try various approaches. After some
        time experimenting, I chose one version where I will keep working on. As
        I love chaotic systems and especially nature, I tried to capture a
        closer look at the transformation of clouds over time. For this, I set
        up my BMPCC6K on a tripod, attached an additional battery, zoomed into a
        spot where I thought the interesting stuff was gonna happen, and then
        waited 30 minutes to 3 hours for each shot. I used an unconventional
        song for such a video because I thought it really fit well.

        Basel at night. Later, I visited my brother's apartment and took some
        shots of his furniture and decoration there, as he and his fianc√©e have
        really good taste in my opinion.

        This is pretty much a collection of lightning footage I took while being

        at home, and the other time in Sigriswil on the mountains. Being part of
        the big chaotic system called weather, lightning is something I really
        adore. I love capturing them to then manipulate time later at home to
        watch what really happens in the small fraction of a second when it all
        occurs. Even if the weather is technically bad, thunderstorms are
        something mighty and mildly scary while being super relaxing. I love
        them.

        I was so much in love with the BMPCC6K that I even took it with me while
        skiing. To be honest, it wasn‚Äôt the smartest idea because the camera has
        no stabilization at all and no autofocus. Additionally, temperatures
        dropped to -20¬∞C, and recording with gloves was almost impossible, so I
        decided to not use them. I also spent like 1-2 hours at the peak to
        record some of the surroundings. I had to stop because I couldn‚Äôt move
        or feel my fingers anymore. When I was at home reviewing my footage, I
        started laughing so hard because the footage where I was skiing while
        recording was so horrendously shaky. But I wasn‚Äôt too sad because I now
        had the knowledge that this absolutely isn‚Äôt a job for this camera with
        my current gear.

        the trails were completely covered in snow. I took my drone and the
        terrible GoPro Fusion with me for this journey. It was a chaotic but
        beautiful day. With this video, I wanted to express the clash between my
        constant urge to calm down and not being able to because I also
        constantly want to do and create things. That‚Äôs also the reason why the
        video has two different parts with different moods.

        Here I went full-on GoPro Fusion. I recorded the footage on a two-day
        hike from Iffigenalp over the Schnidejoch next to the Chilchligletscher
        to the Wildhornh√ºtte SAC, where we spent the night, to then continue the
        next day to Betelberg in Lenk. From there, we rode down to the valley
        with some mountain scooters. It‚Äôs a very nice hike that I‚Äôm gonna repeat
        for sure. But I already had a way-too-heavy backpack without camera
        gear. I only took the horrible GoPro Fusion with me and recorded some
        random stuff and timelapses along the way. You‚Äôve surely noticed my
        slightly massive hate for the GoPro Fusion by now. Let me explain:
        First, I have to stitch together the footage from both lenses of the
        360¬∞ camera with a GoPro application and render it to a weird-looking
        flat 360¬∞ image, which wastes a lot of time. Then, I have to import it
        to Premiere Pro or After Effects to work with the footage using a GoPro
        plugin inside the programs. The GoPro plugin also works with keyframes
        to manipulate the 360¬∞ footage to your liking. But the keyframes
        sometimes just completely ignore my inputs and do their own thing. This
        often results in being unable to exactly position and move the 360¬∞
        footage as I like. Encountering these bugs almost every second makes the
        workflow terrible. The software support even got stopped because they
        discontinued the GoPro Fusion, and I think I know why. But besides that,
        it was a fun project and hike.

        This is a video I've made at a place where I worked as a Polymechanic.
        It‚Äôs about cryoshrinking‚Äîa process where you shrink the smaller inner
        part of two different parts (in this case with nitrogen). Then you put
        them together and let the cold part warm up to room temperature again
        and expand to its original size to create a strong mechanical coupling.
        I took this footage with my Canon EOS 7D. I think it was the last time I
        used this camera to film.
