        Welcome to my portfolio! I've coded the entire website you're currently
        browsing from scratch because I got frustrated with website builders not
        giving me all the control over the design I needed. You were often stuck
        with their templates. Well, I coded most of it myself, but I got really
        big help from Samuel Van Der Stappen. I wouldn't have been able to make
        this on my own, as I'd never used HTML, CSS, or JavaScript before this
        project. He introduced me to web coding, helped with my difficulties,
        and assisted me in tidying up and organizing my code. I also tried to
        use ChatGPT for complicated ideas or troubleshooting, but most of the
        time it caused more issues than it helped. Still, the explanations
        helped me understand the problems I was having and how my ideas could be
        realized.
        <br /><br />
        All in all, I've made the majority of this website myself, and I'm proud
        of it. Technically, the website itself is part of my portfolio. Since I built
        it myself with little experience, it might not be perfectly optimized, and
        you may need to reload the page if some videos don't play.

        This Website isn't fully finished yet and some things aren't working
        properly. But my most of my recent Videos are integrated. There is still
        a lot missing as im still working on it. I'm not happy with the homepage
        yet and the text isn't completed at the moment. The scaling of the
        picture there also isn't behaving like intended.

        Now, onto the actual portfolio part. In this portfolio, you'll find
        almost all of my videos made over the years. I'll try to give a good
        description of what is actually happening in the videos and categorize
        them since all my projects are quite different. You'll find everything
        from calm nature videos to more dynamic content like my drifting and
        mechanical videos, as well as many experimental videos that are all over
        the place thematically.

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-2xl -mt-1.5 pl-3 bg-white">
            My name is Rafael Garcia-Rosa. I'm a Spanish guy born and raised in
            Switzerland by my beautiful family. I fell in love with the concept
            of video production the first time I saw a video. Since then, I've
            spent most of my time, money, and energy creating all kinds of
            videos. <br /><br />
            I started with a GoPro, a potato laptop, and Windows Movie Maker. After
            making 1-2 videos, I got my hands on Sony Vegas, which I loved at the
            time since I didn't know any other software. Later, I switched to Premiere
            Pro and After Effects. From time to time, I also create 3D animations.
            I started with Cinema 4D but switched to Blender. <br /><br />
            I grew up watching Viva and MTV, falling in love with the music videos
            of that era (2004-2014) and music videos in general. Later, I discovered
            YouTube, opening up a world where anyone can show whatever they want
            and do it however they like. I saw so many creative people and soon realized
            nothing was stopping me from doing the sameâ€”except my knowledge. But
            the internet is full of information, so I just started, even without
            knowing how to do it. When my knowledge ran out, I turned to YouTube
            tutorials and research until the project was done.

        MY VIDEO STYLE
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-2xl -mt-1.5 pl-3 bg-white">
        My video style was shaped by influences from MTV and my favorite things
        to watch on YouTube, like FPS edits, car videos (e.g., HOONIGAN), GoPro
        footage, Cyriak, OWSLA, 3D animations, and, of course, music videos. (I
        currently have 2,301 videos in my favorite playlist on YouTube.) <br
        /><br />
        I can't listen to music without imagining a video in my head. Unfortunately,
        I can't realize most of them because I'm not rich or in Hollywood, and camera
        gear is expensive. Plus, time is limited, and I can't do multiple things
        at once. I don't have a single focus, but one thing's certain: there has
        to be music involved. I love editing because it's like blending music with
        moving images. When the music and visuals synchronize perfectly, it feels
        amazing, like dancing with time and space. I listen to tons of music after
        finishing a shoot, or even while recording, from my collection of 5,725 liked
        songs on SoundCloud. The song is a major part of the video for me. I often
        reach out to the artists to ask if I can use their tracks in my videos. Sadly,
        I don't always get a response, but since I'm not making money from these
        projects, I hope it's okay to use them. For client work, I make sure I own
        the rights to all the music I use, although I can't always use my top choices
        because I simply don't get responses from artists or labels.
